# Profile Pic Hider

During the COVID crisis, I started getting annoyed with everyone who felt the need to show their face masks in their social media profile pictures. This script is a blunt instrument that just hides _every_ element that I could find that might contain a profile picture. It is *very* imperfect. I am happy to take constructive criticism or accept offers to help.
