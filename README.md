# Tampermonkey Scripts
This is my personal stash of Tampermonkey scripts. These should not be considered exemplary code, or even "good" code. Feel free to use and improve as you see fit.

### Descriptions
* [profilePicHider.js](https://github.com/rbseaver/tampermonkey-scripts/blob/master/profilePicHider.js): During the COVID crisis, I started getting annoyed with everyone who felt the need to show their face masks in their social media profile pictures. This script does that, but in a very imperfect way while demonstrating my lack of CSS knowledge. I'm also detecting for a number of different events which probably aren't all applicable.
