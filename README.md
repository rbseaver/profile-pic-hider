# Tampermonkey Scripts
This is my personal stash of Tampermonkey scripts. These should not be considered exemplary code, or even "good" code. They are for my personal convenience and I did not get fancy.

### Descriptions
* [profilePicHider.js](https://github.com/rbseaver/tampermonkey-scripts/blob/master/profilePicHider.js): During the COVID crisis, I started getting annoyed with everyone who felt the need to show their face masks in their social media profile pictures. I normally wouldn't feel the need to state this, but since it has become politicized, I need to state that face masks are an effective means of slowing transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Please wear one, but quit showing off. It's a basic public health measure.
