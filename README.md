# Tampermonkey Scripts
This is my personal stash of Tampermonkey scripts. These should not be considered exemplary code, or even "good" code. Feel free to use and improve as you see fit.

### Descriptions
* [profilePicHider.js](https://github.com/rbseaver/tampermonkey-scripts/blob/master/profilePicHider.js): During the COVID crisis, I started getting annoyed with everyone who felt the need to show their face masks in their social media profile pictures. This script is a blunt instrument that just hides _every_ element that I could find that might contain a profile picture. It is very imperfect and showcases my current lack of understanding of CSS. I'm also detecting for a number of different events which probably aren't all applicable. Please contribute of offer suggestions and I'm glad to learn and improve!
